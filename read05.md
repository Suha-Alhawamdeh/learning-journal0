# The color property
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside
an element.

# There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
* RGB values
* hex codes
* color names

You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names by (background-color)

Color pickers can help you find the color you want and it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content?

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA, also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
