# Structure web pages with HTML:

there is a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them , such as:

* <div> : group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar).

* The <header> and <footer>: for the main header or footer that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the site.

* <nav>: used to contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

* <article>: acts as a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

* <aside>: is used inside an <article> element, it should contain
information that is related to the article and used outside of an <article>
element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

* <section>: groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

* <hgroup>: group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.

# Extra Markup:

1. DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
2. You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
3. The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
4. The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
5. <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
6. The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
7. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
