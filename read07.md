A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps:
*1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP 

------------------

A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
