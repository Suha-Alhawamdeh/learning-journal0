# What is A script:
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:
* DEFINE THE GOAL 
* DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
* CODE EACH STEP 

Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.

Expressions and Operators:
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
